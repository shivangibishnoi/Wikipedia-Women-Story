# Wikipedia-Women-Story

### Story Link: [Missing Women on Wikipedia](https://shivangibishnoi.github.io/wikipedia-women-dw/index.html)

#### Data: 
[A Brief History of Human Time - Cross-verified Dataset](https://data.sciencespo.fr/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.21410/7E4/RDAG3O)

#### Code:
```wikidata-code.py``` gets all the women and men from this database of individuals on Wikipedia and gets their notability scores. 
I then calculate the proportion of women by year of birth. 

#### Output:
```wiki-women-data.csv``` has the data used to create the charts in the story.
